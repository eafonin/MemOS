# Building an Intelligent Novel Analysis System with MemOS
 [ 
### ð Why Choose MemOS? Traditional Methods vs MemOS Comparison
 
[Before we start coding, let's see what problems MemOS actually solves:]
 
[[ [![Cookbook-Chapter3-Chart](./IMAGES/cookbook-chapter3-overview-cookbook-chapter3-chart-1.png) ]]]
 
[**Actual Effect Comparison Example:**]
 
[**User asks: "How does the relationship between Xiao Feng and Duan Yu develop?"**]
 
<table><thead><tr><th>Traditional Method</th><th>MemOS Method</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ð Re-search relevant fragments in full text</td><td>â¡ Direct retrieval from relationship layer</td></tr><tr><td>ðµ May miss key plot points</td><td>ð¯ Complete relationship development timeline</td></tr><tr><td>ð Can only answer based on partial text</td><td>ð§  Analysis based on complete character profiles</td></tr></tbody></table>
 
### ð¡ Why Use MemOS Built-in Components?
 
[Imagine you want to cook a dish, you can choose:]
 
- [ð§ **Make all seasonings yourself** - Time-consuming and labor-intensive, hard to guarantee quality]
- [ðª **Use professional seasoning brands** - Time-saving and efficient, stable quality]
 
[MemOS is like a professional "seasoning brand" that has prepared for us:]
 
- [ð¤ **Intelligent dialogue client** - Automatically handles network issues, supports multiple AI models]
- [ð§  **Vectorization service** - Specially optimized Chinese text understanding capabilities]
- [âï¸ **Configuration management** - Simple and easy-to-use parameter settings]
 
[**Learning Gains:**
Through this chapter, you will learn how to prioritize using mature component libraries like professional developers, rather than writing complex underlying code from scratch.]
 
### Chapter Introduction
 
[This chapter will guide you to build an intelligent memory analysis system based on the novel "Demigods and Semi-Devils", implementing a complete conversion process from raw text to structured memory.]
 
[**Core Technical Architecture**:]
 
[[ [![Cookbook-Chapter3-Core](./IMAGES/cookbook-chapter3-overview-cookbook-chapter3-core-en-1.png) ]]]
 
[**Data Processing Pipeline**:]
 
1. [**Text Preprocessing** â Chapter Segmentation â **Structured Input**]
2. [**AI-Driven Extraction** â Character Modeling â **MemCube Generation**]
3. [**Format Conversion** â Graph Structure Construction â **MemOS Memory Repository**]
 
[**System Design Philosophy**:]
 
- [This chapter provides a complete solution from unstructured text to intelligent memory systems]
- [Each recipe solves key technical problems in the data pipeline]
- [Supports large-scale text parallel processing and incremental updates]
- [Builds queryable and reasoning-capable intelligent memory networks]
 
### Environment Configuration
 
```
import requests
import json
import os
import pickle
import time
from datetime import datetime
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry
import re
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any, Set, Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from enum import Enum

```
 
## Recipe 3.0: Text Preprocessing and API Environment Configuration
 
### ð¯ Goal
 
[Establish structured processing foundation for novel text, including chapter segmentation and AI service connection.]
 
### ð Chapter Segmentation Algorithm
 
[Use regular expressions to identify chapter titles and split long novels into processable fragments:]
 
```
def extract_all_chapters(text: str, output_dir: str = "chapters"):
 # Match positions of all "Chapter X" titles
 pattern = r"(ç¬¬[ä¸äºä¸åäºå­ä¸å«ä¹åç¾åé¶ãä¸¤\d]+ç« )"
 matches = list(re.finditer(pattern, text))

 if not matches:
 raise ValueError("No chapter titles found")

 os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

 for i in range(len(matches)):
 start_idx = matches[i].start()
 end_idx = matches[i+1].start() if i+1 Dict:
 """Method to chat with AI - it's that simple!"""
 try:
 response = self.llm.generate(messages)
 return {
 "status": "success", # Success!
 "content": response, # AI's answer
 "model_used": self.llm.config.model_name_or_path # Which model was used
 }
 except Exception as e:
 # ð If there's an error, MemOS will tell us exactly what the problem is
 return {
 "status": "error", 
 "error": str(e),
 "model_used": self.llm.config.model_name_or_path
 }

```
 
### ð Batch Processing Initialization
 
[Establish chapter traversal mechanism, preparing for subsequent parallel processing:]
 
```
# ð¯ Configure your AI assistant (using MemOS makes everything simple)
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY" # ð Fill in your OpenAI API key
API_BASE = "https://api.openai.com/v1" # ð API service address (usually no need to change)
MODEL_NAME = "gpt-4o" # ð¤ Choose your preferred AI model

# ð Create your dedicated AI assistant
api_client = MemOSLLMClient(
 api_key=API_KEY,
 api_base=API_BASE,
 model=MODEL_NAME
)
# Now you have a smart, stable, easy-to-use AI assistant!

memcubes = {} # Global character memory repository
alias_to_name = {} # Alias to standard name mapping
chapter_folder = "chapters"

# Process in chapter order
chapter_files = sorted(
 [os.path.join(chapter_folder, f) for f in os.listdir(chapter_folder) 
 if f.startswith("chapter") and f.endswith(".txt")],
 key=lambda x: int(re.search(r'chapter(\d+)', x).group(1))
)

for chapter_file in chapter_files:
 chapter_id = chapter_file.replace(".txt", "")
 print(f"\nð Processing: {chapter_id}")
 
 with open(chapter_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
 content = f.read()
 # Subsequent processing logic...

```
 
## Recipe 3.1: AI-Driven Character Recognition and Alias Unification
 
### ð¯ Goal
 
[Use AI to automatically identify characters in novels, establish alias mapping relationships, and initialize character memory containers.]
 
### ð§  Intelligent Character Recognition
 
[Implement accurate character extraction and alias merging through carefully designed prompts:]
 
```
@staticmethod
def extract_character_names_prompt(paragraph: str, alias_to_name: dict = None):
 system_msg = (
 "You are a novel character recognition expert. Please extract all explicitly mentioned characters from the following novel excerpt.\n"
 "For each character, please mark the character's standard name (such as \"Qiao Feng\") and all titles, aliases, and references that appear in this excerpt (such as \"Beggar Gang Leader\", \"Leader Qiao\", \"that big man\").\n\n"
 "Please return in the following JSON format:\n"
 "[\n"
 " {\n"
 " \"name\": \"Qiao Feng\",\n"
 " \"aliases\": [\"Beggar Gang Leader\", \"Leader Qiao\", \"that big man\"]\n"
 " }\n"
 "]\n\n"
 "â ï¸ Note:\n"
 "1. Only include characters, not locations or organizations.\n"
 "2. Multiple titles of the same character should be unified in the same entry.\n"
 "3. Use standard JSON format for all fields. Do not include markdown symbols or comments.\n"
 "4. If you cannot determine whether a title refers to a new character, you may temporarily keep it as a separate entry."
 )

 if alias_to_name:
 system_msg += "\n\nThe following are known aliases corresponding to standard character names. Please try to categorize newly recognized titles under existing characters:\n"
 alias_map_str = json.dumps(alias_to_name, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
 system_msg += alias_map_str

 return [
 {"role": "system", "content": system_msg},
 {"role": "user", "content": f"Novel excerpt as follows:\n{paragraph}"}

```
 
### ð¾ MemCube Initialization and Alias Management
 
[Create structured memory containers for each identified character:]
 
```
def init_memcube(character_name: str, chunk_id: str):
 """Initialize character memory cube - contains all core fields"""
 return {
 "name": character_name,
 "first_appearance": chunk_id,
 "aliases": [character_name],
 "events": [],
 "utterances": [],
 "speech_style": "",
 "personality_traits": [],
 "emotion_state": "",
 "relations": []
 }

# Execute character recognition and initialization
name_prompt = Prompt.extract_character_names_prompt(content, alias_to_name)
name_result = api_client.call_api(name_prompt, TaskType.EVENT_EXTRACTION, timeout=1800)

try:
 extracted = json.loads(name_result.get("content", "").strip("```json").strip("```").strip())
except:
 extracted = []

# Update character repository and alias mapping
for item in extracted:
 std_name = item["name"]
 aliases = item.get("aliases", [])
 
 # Initialize or update MemCube
 if std_name not in memcubes:
 print(f"ð New character identified: {std_name}")
 memcubes[std_name] = init_memcube(std_name, chapter_id)
 memcubes[std_name]["aliases"] = []

 # Merge alias lists
 all_aliases = list(set(memcubes[std_name].get("aliases", []) + aliases))
 memcubes[std_name]["aliases"] = all_aliases

 # Build global alias mapping
 for alias in [std_name] + aliases:
 alias_to_name[alias] = std_name

```
 
## Recipe 3.2: Structured Memory Content Extraction
 
### ð¯ Goal
 
[Use AI to extract structured character information from novel text, including events, quotes, personality, emotions, and relationship networks.]
 
### ð­ Multi-dimensional Information Extraction Prompt
 
[Design precise prompt templates to ensure AI returns standardized JSON data:]
 
```
@staticmethod
def update_character_prompt(character_name: str, unfinished_events: list, paragraph: str):
 return [
 {
 "role": "system",
 "content": (
 "You are a novel character modeling expert who will analyze a character's unfinished events and the latest novel excerpt.\n"
 "Your task is to update the following fields:\n"
 "- events: Event list (update status, add new events, including subfields event_id, action, motivation, impact, involved_entities, time, location, event, if_completed)\n"
 "- Each event must include a unique \"event_id\", such as \"event_001\", \"event_002\", etc.\n"
 "- utterances: Things said (with time or event number)\n"
 "- speech_style: Speaking style (such as classical, direct, sarcastic, etc.)\n"
 "- personality_traits: Personality (such as calm, impulsive)\n"
 "- emotion_state: Current emotional state\n"
 "- relations: List of relationships with others\n\n"
 "Please pay special attention to the following requirements:\n"
 "1. Please carefully judge whether existing unfinished events have ended in the new excerpt.\n"
 "2. If an event has an ending or result, please mark its `if_completed` field as true.\n"
 "3. If new events related to this character appear in the novel excerpt, please add new event entries.\n"
 "Finally, please output the following JSON structure:\n"
 "{\n"
 " \"events\": [...],\n"
 " \"utterances\": [...],\n"
 " \"speech_style\": \"...\",\n"
 " \"personality_traits\": [...],\n"
 " \"emotion_state\": \"...\",\n"
 " \"relations\": [...]\n"
 "}\n\n"
 "â ï¸ Please note:\n"
 "1. All field names must be wrapped in double quotes (JSON standard format).\n"
 "2. Do not add comment symbols, additional explanations, or markdown symbols.\n"
 "3. Only return complete JSON object, cannot be array or other formats.\n"
 "4. If there is no content to fill, please use empty array [] or empty string \"\".\n"
 )

 f"Novel excerpt as follows:\n{paragraph}\n\n"
 "Please return the character's updated information in the above format."
 )
 }

```
 
### ð Intelligent Data Merging Algorithm
 
[Implement event state tracking and incremental update mechanisms:]
 
```
def get_unfinished_events(memcube: dict):
 """Get list of unfinished events - for context continuity"""

 else:
 key = str(item)
 if key not in seen:
 seen.add(key)
 result.append(item)
 return result

```
 
### â¡ Parallel Processing Engine
 
[Use thread pools to implement efficient batch character updates:]
 
```
# Parallel update of all character states
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor:
 futures = {
 executor.submit(update_memcube_for_character, name, memcube, content, chapter_id): name

## Recipe 3.3: Memory-Based Intelligent Reasoning System
 
### ð¯ Goal
 
[Implement advanced functions such as novel plot reasoning, rationality assessment, and emotional analysis based on the constructed MemCube.]
 
### ð® Plot Deduction Engine
 
[Use complete character memory information for story development prediction:]
 
```

### ð­ Multi-dimensional Analysis Framework
 
[Provide professional analysis tools such as emotional trajectory, conflict progression, and stance judgment:]
 
```
@staticmethod

```
# Load the constructed character memory repository
with open("memcubes1.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
 memcubes = json.load(f)

character_name = "Duan Yu"
user_input = "What would happen if Duan Yu did not appear at the Sword Lake Palace martial arts competition?"

# Execute plot deduction

response = api_client.call_api(prompt, TaskType.EVENT_EXTRACTION)
print(response.get("content", "â No return"))

```
 
## Recipe 3.4: Embedding Model Optimization Configuration
 
### ð Embedding Model Switching for Chinese Text Retrieval
 
[**Reason for Switching:**]
 
[The original code uses the nomic-embed model for text vectorization, but this model is primarily optimized for English text and has the following issues when processing Chinese novel content:]
 
1. [**Limited Chinese semantic understanding**: The nomic-embed-text model is mainly trained on English corpora, with weak semantic understanding and text relationship capture capabilities for Chinese language]
2. [**Insufficient retrieval accuracy**: In Chinese novels like "Demigods and Semi-Devils", semantic similarity calculations for character, event, and relationship retrieval are not accurate enough]
3. [**Missing cultural background**: Cannot well understand specific contexts such as martial arts, history, and culture in Chinese literary works]
 
[**Recommended Replacement Solutions:**]
 
[According to [[Mem0 official documentation](https://docs.mem0.ai/components/embedders/models/openai)] and [[Chinese embedding model evaluation](https://github.com/wangyuxinwhy/uniem)], the following configurations are recommended:]
 
#### Option 1: OpenAI Embedding (Recommended)
 
```
config = {
 "embedder": {
 "provider": "openai",
 "config": {
 "model": "text-embedding-3-large", # Supports multiple languages, excellent Chinese performance
 "embedding_dims": 3072,
 "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
 }
 }
}

```
 
[**Advantages:**]
 
- [Supports Chinese and English bilingual, excellent performance in Chinese text retrieval tasks]
- [Higher vector dimensions (3072), richer semantic representation]
- [Good performance in MTEB-zh evaluation]
 
#### Option 2: M3E Model (Open Source Alternative)
 
```
config = {
 "embedder": {
 "provider": "huggingface", 
 "config": {
 "model": "moka-ai/m3e-base", # Open source model specifically optimized for Chinese
 "embedding_dims": 768
 }
 }
}

```
 
[**Advantages:**]
 
- [Specifically trained for Chinese, superior to OpenAI ada-002 in Chinese text classification and retrieval]
- [Supports heterogeneous text retrieval, suitable for novel character relationships and event retrieval]
- [Completely open source, no API call fees]
 
#### Option 3: Local Deployment
 
```
config = {
 "embedder": {
 "provider": "ollama",
 "config": {
 "model": "moka-ai/m3e-base",
 "ollama_base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
 }
 }
}

```
 
[**Performance Comparison Data:**]
 
[According to [[MTEB-zh evaluation](https://github.com/wangyuxinwhy/uniem)] results:]
 
<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Chinese Text Classification Accuracy</th><th>Chinese Retrieval ndcg@10</th><th>Advantage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>nomic-embed</td><td>Not tested</td><td>Not tested</td><td>English optimization</td></tr><tr><td>OpenAI text-embedding-3-large</td><td>0.6231</td><td>0.7786+</td><td>Multilingual support</td></tr><tr><td>M3E-base</td><td>0.6157</td><td>0.8004</td><td>Chinese specialization</td></tr></tbody></table>
 
## Recipe 3.5: Memory Graph Structure Transformer
 
### ð¯ Goal
 
[Convert MemCube data to MemOS-compatible Memory node format, building a queryable knowledge graph.]
 
### ðï¸ Memory Node Generation
 
[Convert character events and relationships to standardized Memory objects:]
 
```
def create_memory_node(content: str, entities: list, key: str, memory_type: str = "fact") -> dict:
 """Create standardized Memory node"""
 node_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
 now = datetime.now().isoformat()
 
 # Simulate embedding (in real applications, should use actual embedding service)
 embedding = [0.1] * 768 # Example dimension
 
 return {
 "id": node_id,

### ð Intelligent Retrieval Validation
 
[Validate system performance through multi-dimensional queries:]
 
```
# Multi-type query testing
test_queries = [
 "Duan Yu's first encounter with the fairy sister",
 "Qiao Feng's identity mystery",
 "Xu Zhu's adventure experiences",
 "The grudge between Ding Chunqiu and Wu Yazi"
]

for query in test_queries:
 print(f"\nð Query: {query}")
 results = tree_memory.search(query, top_k=3)
 
 for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
 relativity = result.metadata.relativity if hasattr(result.metadata, 'relativity') else 0.0
 print(f" {i}. Relevance: {relativity:.3f}")
 print(f" Content: {result.memory[:100]}...")

## ð¯ Creative Extensions Based on MemOS
 
[Congratulations! You have mastered the core technologies of MemOS. Now let's see what exciting applications we can create:]
 
### ð°ï¸ Creative 1: Intelligent World Timeline System
 
[Build a dynamic martial arts world timeline based on MemOS, letting AI understand causal relationships between events:]
 
```
# Example: Intelligent timeline management
timeline_memory = {
 "1094": {
 "events": ["Xiao Feng's identity mystery revealed", "Battle at Juxian Manor"],
 "consequences": ["Martial world shaken", "Beggar Gang split"],
 "affected_characters": ["Xiao Feng", "A'Zhu", "Duan Zhengchun"]
 },
 "1095": {
 "events": ["Truth of Yanmen Pass incident", "A'Zhu's death"],
 "consequences": ["Xiao Feng's mindset transformation", "Song-Liao tension"]
 }
}

# AI can answer: What would happen if Xiao Feng didn't go to Yanmen Pass?

```
 
### ð§  Creative 2: Dynamic Working Memory World Background
 
[Use MemCube's working memory functionality to update world background in real-time as the plot develops:]
 
```
# Example: Dynamic world state management
from memos.memories.textual.base import TextualMemoryItem

# Create world state memory items
world_state_memories = [
 TextualMemoryItem(
 memory="Song-Liao political tension reaches 0.8 level, border conflicts frequent",
 metadata={"type": "world_state", "category": "politics"}
 ),
 TextualMemoryItem(
 memory="Current legendary martial arts in jianghu: Nine Yang Divine Skill, Muscle-Tendon Changing Classic",
 metadata={"type": "world_state", "category": "martial_arts"}
 ),
 TextualMemoryItem(
 memory="Shaolin and Wudang maintain neutrality, Beggar Gang has internal split",
 metadata={"type": "world_state", "category": "sect_relations"}
 )
]

# Use MemCube's text memory to manage world state
mem_cube.text_mem.replace_working_memory(world_state_memories)

# When Xiao Feng makes important decisions, automatically update working memory
current_working_memory = mem_cube.text_mem.get_working_memory()

```

[**Game Gameplay Example:**]
 
```
Player: I am a young man new to jianghu, wanting to visit Xiao Feng
AI: At that time, Xiao Feng was investigating his identity mystery in the Luoyang area, you encountered him in an inn...
 Xiao Feng looked at you, a young man, and asked: "Little brother, what are you doing out so late?"

Player: I tell him I want to learn martial arts and ask him to take me as disciple
AI: Xiao Feng laughed heartily: "My own identity is a mystery, how can I be qualified to be a teacher?
 But since we met, it's fate. I can teach you a few moves for self-defense..."
 [Your martial arts level +1, relationship with Xiao Feng +5]

Player: I want to tell Xiao Feng the truth about his identity
AI: This is a dangerous choice! Revealing identity prematurely might change the entire story direction...
 Are you sure you want to do this? This will open a completely new plot branch.
