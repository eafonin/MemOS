title: Quick Start
desc: Welcome to the MemOS Cloud Platform. Refer to this quick start guide to easily integrate memory capabilities. You’ll need to complete the following steps.
---

## 1. Get Your API Key

Register and log in to the [MemOS Cloud Platform](https://memos-dashboard.openmem.net/quickstart). A default project will be created for you automatically. Copy the default API Key from the console.

## 2. Core Memory Operations

### 2.1 Add Original Messages

**Conversation A: Occurred on 2025-06-10**<br>
Simply provide the **raw conversation records** to MemOS.  MemOS will <code style="font-weight: bold;">automatically abstract, process, and save them as memory</code>.

::code-group
```python [Python (HTTP)]
import os
import requests
import json

# Replace with your API Key
os.environ["MEMOS_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
os.environ["MEMOS_BASE_URL"] = "https://memos.memtensor.cn/api/openmem/v1"

data = {
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I want to travel during summer vacation, can you recommend something?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Are you traveling alone, with family or with friends?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I’m bringing my kid. My family always travels together."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it, so you’re traveling with your children as a family, right?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, with both kids and elderly, we usually travel as a whole family."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Understood, I’ll recommend destinations suitable for family trips."}
  ],
  "user_id": "memos_user_123",
  "conversation_id": "0610"
}
headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Authorization": f"Token {os.environ['MEMOS_API_KEY']}"
}
url = f"{os.environ['MEMOS_BASE_URL']}/add/message"

requests.post(url=url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
```
```python [Python (SDK)]
# Please ensure that MemOS has been installed (pip install MemoryOS -U)
from memos.api.client import MemOSClient

# Initialize MemOS client with API Key to start sending requests
client = MemOSClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

messages = [
  {"role": "user", "content": "I want to travel during summer vacation, can you recommend something?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Are you traveling alone, with family or with friends?"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "I’m bringing my kid. My family always travels together."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it, so you’re traveling with your children as a family, right?"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, with both kids and elderly, we usually travel as a whole family."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Understood, I’ll recommend destinations suitable for family trips."}
]
user_id = "memos_user_123"
conversation_id = "0610"

client.add_message(messages=messages, user_id=user_id, conversation_id=conversation_id)
```
```bash [Curl]
curl --request POST \
  --url https://memos.memtensor.cn/api/openmem/v1/add/message \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "user_id": "memos_user_123",
    "conversation_id": "0610",
    "messages": [
      {"role":"user","content":"I want to travel during summer vacation, can you recommend something?"},
      {"role":"assistant","content":"Sure! Are you traveling alone, with family or with friends?"},
      {"role":"user","content":"I'\''m bringing my kid. My family always travels together."},
      {"role":"assistant","content":"Got it, so you'\''re traveling with your children as a family, right?"},
      {"role":"user","content":"Yes, with both kids and elderly, we usually travel as a whole family."},
      {"role":"assistant","content":"Understood, I'\''ll recommend destinations suitable for family trips."}
    ]
  }'
```

{
	"code": 0,
	"data": {
		"success": true
	},
	"message": "ok"
}
```

### 2.2 Search Memory

**Conversation A: Occurred on 2025-09-28**<br>
Use the user's utterance to search memory, and MemOS will automatically retrieve the most relevant memories for the AI to reference.

> MemOS supports returning **`matches`**, **`instruction`** (coming soon), and **`full_instruction`** (coming soon). In practice, you only need to choose one according to your business needs.

> - **Need full control** → use **matches**, which only returns memory entries, and developers manually stitch them into instructions.  
> - **Want to save stitching work but still need to apply business rules** → use **instruction**, where the system has already combined memories with the user’s query into a semi-finished instruction, which developers can further refine.  
> - **Pursue one-click direct connection** → use **full_instruction**, where the system generates a complete terminal instruction that can be directly sent to the LLM.

> **Why this design**: Most memory systems stop at “recalling facts,” but facts do not equal an executable Prompt. MemOS’s unique instruction completion workflow saves you from complex stitching and fine-tuning, turning memories into prompts that the model can directly understand and execute.
