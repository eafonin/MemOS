title: Documentation Writing Guidelines
desc: This project uses Nuxt Content to build a documentation system that supports Markdown and rich Vue components.
---

## Creating New Documents

::steps
### Create Markdown File
Create a new `.md` file in the `content/` directory or its subdirectories. Choose an appropriate location based on your content type.

### Add Frontmatter
Add YAML frontmatter at the top of your file to provide metadata. The frontmatter supports the following fields:

::card{title="Frontmatter Fields"}
**Required Fields:**
- `title` (string) - The document title that appears in navigation and page headers

**Optional Fields:**
- `desc` (string) - Brief description of the document content
- `banner` (string) - URL to a banner image displayed at the top of the page
- `links` (array) - Array of related links with labels, URLs, and icons

![Frontmatter Example](./IMAGES/image_001.png)
::

**Complete Frontmatter Example:**

```yaml

```

### Write Content
Use Markdown syntax and MDC components to write your documentation content. Take advantage of the available components to create engaging and well-structured content.

### Update Navigation
Add the new document to the `nav` section in `content/settings.yml` to make it accessible through the site navigation.

### Merge to Main Branch
Once changes are merged into the `main` branch, the documentation will be automatically updated and deployed.
::

## Component Examples

This project uses Nuxt Content's MDC (Markdown Components) syntax, which supports using Vue components within Markdown. These components help create engaging, well-structured documentation with consistent styling and improved user experience.

### Image References

When adding images to your documentation, you can use several methods to reference them:

#### Local Assets with Base64Image Component

For images stored in the `public/assets` directory, use the `Base64Image` component. This component provides better performance by embedding the image directly in the page:

```mdc
:Base64Image{src="/assets/memos-architecture.png" alt="MemOS Architecture"}
```

#### Remote Images with Markdown Syntax

For remote images (hosted on external servers), use standard Markdown image syntax:

```markdown
![MemOS Architecture](./IMAGES/image_002.png)
```

### Steps

Use `steps` to create step-by-step guides from document headings. The `steps` component automatically numbers headings, creating a numbered guide for processes and tutorials.

  #### Install MemOS
  
  ```bash
  pip install MemoryOS
  ```
  
  #### Create a Minimal Config
  
  For this Quick Start, we'll use the built-in GeneralTextMemory.
  
  ```python
  from memos.configs.mem_os import MOSConfig
  
  # init MOSConfig
  mos_config = MOSConfig.from_json_file("examples/data/config/simple_memos_config.json")
  ```
  
  #### Create a User & Register a MemCube
  
  ```python
  import uuid
  from memos.mem_os.main import MOS
  
  mos = MOS(mos_config)
  
  # Generate a unique user ID
  user_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
  
  # Create the user
  mos.create_user(user_id=user_id)
  ```

### Accordion

Use `accordion` and `accordion-item` to create collapsible content sections. Accordions are useful for organizing FAQs, expandable details, or grouped information in an interactive way.

::code-preview

class: "[&>div]:*:my-0"
---
  :::accordion
    ::::accordion-item
    ---
    icon: i-lucide-circle-help
    label: Is MemOS compatible with LLMs accessed via API?
    ---
    Yes. MemOS is designed to be as compatible as possible with various types of models. However, it's important to note that if you're using API-based models, activation and parametric memories cannot be utilized.
    ::::
  
    ::::accordion-item
    ---
    icon: i-lucide-circle-help
    label: How does MemOS improve the effectiveness of large language model applications?
    ---
    MemOS enhances large language model applications by providing structured, persistent memory with intelligent scheduling, long-term knowledge retention, and KV cache for fast inference. It supports fine-grained access control and user isolation, ensuring memory security in multi-user environments. Its modular architecture allows seamless integration of new memory types, LLMs, and storage backends, making it adaptable to a wide range of intelligent applications.

### Badge

Use badge to display status indicators or labels. Badges are great for highlighting version numbers, statuses, or categories within your content.

::code-preview
---
label: Preview
---
  :::badge
  **v1.0.0**
  :::

#code
```mdc
::badge
**v1.0.0**
::
```
::



### Callout

Use callout to emphasize important contextual information. Callouts draw attention to notes, tips, warnings, or cautions, making key information stand out.

Customize with `icon` and `color` props or use `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution` shortcuts for pre-defined semantic styles.

    Basic note content
    ::::

    ::::note{.w-full.my-0 to="/open_source/getting_started/quick_start"}
    Note with link - click to navigate to quick start guide

    ::::
  
    ::::caution{.w-full.my-0}
    This action cannot be undone.

### Card

Use `card` to highlight content blocks. Cards are useful for showcasing features, resources, or related information in visually distinct and interactive containers.

Customize with `title`, `icon`, and `color` props. Cards can also act as links using `<NuxtLink>` properties for navigation.

::code-preview

class: "[&>div]:*:my-0 [&>div]:*:w-full"

  :::card

### CardGroup

Use `card-group` to arrange cards in a grid layout. `card-group` is ideal for displaying collections of cards in a structured, visually appealing, and responsive grid.

## Navigation Icons

When adding navigation entries in `content/settings.yml`, you can include icons using the syntax `(ri:icon-name)`:

```yaml
- "(ri:home-line) Home": overview.md
- "(ri:team-line) User Management": modules/mos/users.md
- "(ri:flask-line) Writing Tests": contribution/writing_tests.md
```

Available icons can be found at: [https://icones.js.org/](https://icones.js.org/)

## Local Preview

To preview the documentation locally, run the following command from the project root:


```bash
## Make sure to install the dependencies:
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command will start a local web server, usually accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Best Practices

::note
**Documentation Writing Tips**

1. **Keep document structure clear**: Use appropriate heading levels to organize content logically
2. **Use components wisely**: Use note, card, and other components to improve readability and engagement
3. **Code examples**: Provide clear code examples for technical documentation with proper syntax highlighting
4. **Icon usage**: Use appropriate icons in navigation to enhance user experience and visual hierarchy

::card{title="Quick Reference"}
Remember to test your documentation locally before submitting. Use `npm run dev` to preview your changes and ensure all components render correctly.
