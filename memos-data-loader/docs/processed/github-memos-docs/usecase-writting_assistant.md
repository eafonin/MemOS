title: A Writing Assistant with Memory is More Useful
desc: With MemOS, your product will automatically remember the user's writing habits and context, making the creative process more coherent and effortless.
---

## 1. Overview

In writing assistant products, users often hope that the assistant can **remember their writing style and habits** instead of starting from scratch each time.

*   **Writing Style**  
    "When helping me write a summary, keep the tone light."
    
*   **Common Information**  
    "Remember that I am in charge of the Marketing Department at XX company."
    
*   **Writing Preferences**  
    "From now on, always start emails with 'Dear Customer.'"
    
*   **Context Continuity**  
    "Please further optimize yesterday‚Äôs proposal summary by adding the budget section."
    

Without memory, this information is lost once the conversation ends. Users must repeatedly remind the assistant, which makes the experience feel fragmented and unprofessional.


### 1.1 Why Not Use Traditional RAG?

In the writing assistant scenario, RAG is not suitable.

| Traditional RAG | MemOS |
| --- | --- |
| Relies on a static knowledge base, requiring constant manual document maintenance | Information generated in the conversation can be directly written in, no extra maintenance required |
| Retrieval results are usually generic knowledge fragments | Can store and retrieve personalized style, tone, and commonly used expressions |
| More suitable for ‚Äúcompany documents/encyclopedia knowledge‚Äù | More suitable for ‚Äúcontinuous iteration and personalization‚Äù in writing assistants |


### 1.2 Why Not Build It Yourself?

Of course, you could try to save user preferences and context in a database, but this brings several challenges:

*   **Complex storage and retrieval logic**: You need to distinguish main text, preferences, and user profiles, and design retrieval strategies.
    
*   **Troublesome integration with large models**: Storing is only the first step; before calling the large model, you still need to ‚Äúinsert‚Äù the relevant information into the prompt.
    
*   **Poor scalability**: As user needs increase (writing style, common phrases, contextual links), the code will quickly become bloated.
    

### 1.3 Why Use MemOS?

When making a choice, you can directly compare the three approaches:

| Approach | Features | Limitations | Advantages of MemOS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Traditional RAG** | Retrieves documents from a vector knowledge base and inserts into the prompt | Requires manual maintenance of static documents; unsuitable for personalized writing habits | Automatically captures styles and preferences revealed by users during conversations |
| **Self-built Storage Solution** | Build your own tables/caches to save preferences and content | Complex logic: must distinguish main text/preferences/profiles; manual prompt insertion needed; difficult to scale | MemOS encapsulates storage + retrieval + prompt injection, reducing development burden |
| **MemOS** | Just two APIs: `addMessage` for writing, `searchMemory` for retrieval | ‚Äî‚Äî | Supports long-term tracking of writing styles and reuse of common information; out-of-the-box and easy to expand |


### 1.4 What Will This Case Show?

This case demonstrates how to use the MemOS cloud service to quickly implement a writing assistant that ‚Äúremembers the user.‚Äù

In this demo, the user may:

*   Set preferences: ‚ÄúWhen helping me write a summary, keep the tone light.‚Äù
    
*   Reuse background: ‚ÄúRemember that I am in charge of the Marketing Department at XX company.‚Äù
    
*   Iterate tasks: ‚ÄúPlease further optimize yesterday‚Äôs proposal summary by adding the budget section.‚Äù
    

With MemOS, the writing assistant can:

1.  **Maintain Style**: Keep consistent tone and formatting as required by the user.
    
2.  **Reuse Information**: Automatically include the user‚Äôs common background information.
    
3.  **Iterate Quickly**: Modify based on existing content instead of starting over.
    

When running this case script, developers will see in the console:

*   Each `addMessage` and `searchMemory` request/response
    
*   Retrieved memories such as writing style and background information
    
*   The final model-generated answer (if no large model is connected, it will display [No model connected])

### 2.3 Code Explanation

1.   Set your MemOS API key and OpenAI key in environment variables.
    
2.   Instantiate `WritingAssistant`.
    
3.   Choose whether to run pre-configured dialogues, which will consume 2 add and 2 search calls.
    
4.   Use the `main()` function to interact with the assistant through a dialogue loop.
    
5.   The assistant will call `chat`: first execute `search` to retrieve memories, then call OpenAI for dialogue, and finally execute `add` to store memories.
