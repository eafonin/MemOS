MemOS provides two usage options:

1. **Cloud Service Platform** ‚Äî the fastest way to get started, only requires an API Key.  
2. **Open-source Framework** ‚Äî for local/private deployment, convenient for secondary development and deep integration.  

> Whether **Cloud Service** or **Open-source Framework**, MemOS enables your AI to **easily obtain persistent memory**.<br>You can start with the cloud service for a quick experience, then switch to localized deployment as needed.

## 1. Option One: Cloud Service Platform

When building applications with large models, a common problem is: **How can AI remember users‚Äô long-term preferences?**  
MemOS provides two core APIs to help you achieve this:

- `addMessage` ‚Äî Submit raw conversations to us, we automatically process and store them as memory  
- `searchMemory` ‚Äî Recall relevant memories and optional suggested instructions in subsequent conversations, making AI responses more aligned with user needs

### Step 1. Get API Key

Register an account on the [MemOS Cloud Platform](https://memos-dashboard.openmem.net/quickstart) to obtain the default API Key.

### Step 2. Store raw conversations (addMessage)

::note
**Conversation A: occurred on 2025-06-10**<br>

You only need to provide the `raw conversation logs` to MemOS, and MemOS will `automatically abstract, process, and save them as memory`.
::

```python
import os
import requests
import json

os.environ["MEMOS_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
os.environ["MEMOS_BASE_URL"] = "https://memos.memtensor.cn/api/openmem/v1"

data = {
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I want to travel during summer vacation, can you recommend something?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Are you traveling alone or with family/friends?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Of course I‚Äôm bringing my kid, our family always travels together."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it, so you‚Äôre traveling with your children as a family, right?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, with both kids and elderly, we usually travel as a whole family."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Understood, I‚Äôll recommend destinations suitable for family trips."}
  ],
  "user_id": "memos_user_123",
  "conversation_id": "0610"
}

headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Authorization": f"Token {os.environ['MEMOS_API_KEY']}"
}

url = f"{os.environ['MEMOS_BASE_URL']}/add/message"

res = requests.post(url=url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

print(res.json())
```

### Step 3. Query MemOS for relevant memories within conversations (searchMemory)

::note
**Conversation B: occurred on 2025-09-28**<br>

In a new conversation, when the user asks AI to recommend a National Day trip plan, MemOS automatically recalls relevant memories for AI reference, enabling more personalized recommendations.
::

> MemOS supports returning **`related memories (matches)`**, **`stitched instructions (instruction)` (coming soon)**, and **`full instructions (full_instruction)` (coming soon)** simultaneously. In practice, you only need to choose one based on your business needs.

> - **Need full control** ‚Üí use **matches**, only returns memory items, developers manually stitch them into instructions;  
> - **Want to save stitching work, but still need to add business rules** ‚Üí use **instruction**, system has combined memories and user query into semi-finished instructions, developers can further refine them;  
> - **Pursue one-click direct use** ‚Üí use **full_instruction**, system has generated complete terminal instructions ready to be sent to the model.

> **Why this design**: Most memory systems stop at ‚Äúrecalling facts‚Äù, but facts ‚â† executable Prompts. MemOS‚Äôs unique instruction completion chain saves you from complex stitching and fine-tuning, directly converting memories into model-readable and executable prompts.

```python
import os
import requests
import json

os.environ["MEMOS_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
os.environ["MEMOS_BASE_URL"] = "https://memos.memtensor.cn/api/openmem/v1"

data = {
    "user_id": "memos_user_123",  
    "conversation_id": "0928",
    "query": "Where to go for National Day travel?",
    "memory_limit_number": 6  # Optional, default is 6 if not provided

    # ==== Coming Soon ====
    # The following parameters will be supported in future versions, please do not pass them now
    # "return_matches": True,
    # "return_instruction": True,
    # "return_full_instruction": True
}

headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Authorization": f"Token {os.environ['MEMOS_API_KEY']}"
}
url = f"{os.environ['MEMOS_BASE_URL']}/search/memory"

res = requests.post(url=url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

results = res.json()  

# Mode 1: Related Memories (matches)
print("Related Memories:", results["data"]["memory_detail_list"])
# Example output(simplified here for easier understanding, for reference only):
# [
#   {
#     "memory_key": "Travel Habit",
#     "memory_value": "Travel with whole family (including kids and elderly)",
#     "confidence": 0.97,
#     "update_time": "2025-06-10T10:00:00Z"
#   }
# ]

# Mode 2 (coming soon): Stitched Instruction (semi-finished, structured, easy for further processing)
# print("Instruction:", results["data"]["instruction"])
# Example output:
# Task: Answer user‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhere to go for National Day travel?‚Äù
# Audience: Family trip (including kids and elderly)
# Requirements:
# - Explicitly consider the needs of children and elderly in the response
# - Destination suggestions must align with ‚Äúfamily-friendly‚Äù
# Notes: If key information is missing (departure, budget, duration), add clarification strategies via business logic

# Mode 3 (coming soon): Full Instruction (terminal form, can be directly sent to model)
# print("Full Instruction:", results["data"]["full_instruction"])
# Example output:
# You are a travel consultant.
# The user always travels with their whole family (including kids and elderly).
# Directly answer ‚ÄúWhere to go for National Day travel?‚Äù and prioritize family-friendly destinations.
# If information is insufficient, first ask clarification questions before giving suggestions.
```

## 2. Option Two: Open-source Framework

For local deployment or deep customization, you can directly use MemOS‚Äôs open-source framework. Compared with cloud services, the open-source framework has no extra abstraction layer. Developers need to explicitly handle **memory extraction, storage, and retrieval**, all of which operate on a **MemCube**.

> MemCube is the basic container of memory, responsible for storing user memory items. The `addMessage` and `searchMemory` APIs in the cloud service are essentially abstracted wrappers around internal operations of MemCube. In the open-source framework, developers can directly control these steps.

For detailed operation steps, see: [Open-source Project ‚Üí Quick Start](https://memos-docs.openmem.net/open_source/getting_started/quick_start)

## 3. Next Steps

### 3.1 Learn about MemOS Memory Production Process

Here we will explain in detail **how a message entering the system is processed into memory and effectively used in future conversations**, to help you better understand MemOS‚Äôs memory mechanism and advantages.

::note
**Deep Understanding**<br>
MemOS‚Äôs memory mechanism can be understood as a complete ‚Äúworkflow‚Äù:  
You submit raw messages ‚Üí Processed into memory ‚Üí Scheduling mechanism arranges invocation and storage based on task and context, and dynamically adjusts memory forms ‚Üí Relevant memories are recalled when needed and injected as context or instructions ‚Üí Lifecycle management ensures evolution and updates.

- [Memory Recall & Instruction Completion](/overview/quick_start/mem_recall)  
- [Memory Lifecycle Management](/overview/quick_start/mem_lifecycle)  

### 3.2 Practice with MemOS

We provide three concrete business reference cases for you to review:

- [Help financial assistant understand client preferences behind behaviors](/usecase/financial_assistant)  
  - In intelligent investment advisory, user clicks, browsing, bookmarks, and communication all form behavioral traces for profiling.  
  - MemOS can abstract these behaviors into memories, e.g. ‚ÄúRisk preference = Conservative‚Äù.  
  - When the user asks ‚ÄúWhat kind of investment suits me?‚Äù, the assistant can directly leverage them to provide more professional and personalized advice.  

- [Build a family life assistant with memory](/usecase/home_assistant)  
  - A family assistant doesn‚Äôt just answer immediate questions, it also remembers your to-dos, preferences, and family information.  
  - For example: ‚ÄúTake kids to the zoo on Saturday‚Äù or ‚ÄúRemind me by listing key points first‚Äù, MemOS converts these into memories.  
  - In later conversations, they automatically take effect, making the assistant closer to real life.  

- [A writing assistant with memory is more useful](/usecase/writting_assistant)  
  - A writing assistant should not only generate content but also maintain consistent tone and style.  
  - With MemOS, user writing preferences, frequently used information, and contextual instructions can all be remembered.  
  - Next time, when writing a summary or email, no need to repeat reminders‚Äîachieve coherent and personalized writing experience.
