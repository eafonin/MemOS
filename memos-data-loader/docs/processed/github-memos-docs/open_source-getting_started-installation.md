## Basic Installation

The simplest way to install MemOS is using pip:

```bash
pip install MemoryOS -U
```

For detailed development environment setup, workflow guidelines, and contribution best practices, please see our [Contribution Guide](/open_source/contribution/overview).

## Optional Dependencies

MemOS provides several optional dependency groups for different features. You can install them based on your needs.

| Feature          | Package Name              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Tree Memory      | `MemoryOS[tree-mem]`      |
| Memory Reader    | `MemoryOS[mem-reader]`    |
| Memory Scheduler | `MemoryOS[mem-scheduler]` |

Example installation commands:

```bash
pip install MemoryOS[tree-mem]
pip install MemoryOS[tree-mem,mem-reader]
pip install MemoryOS[mem-scheduler]
pip install MemoryOS[tree-mem,mem-reader,mem-scheduler]
```

## External Dependencies

### Ollama Support
