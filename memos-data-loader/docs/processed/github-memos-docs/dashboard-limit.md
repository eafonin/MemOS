## 1. Free Quota

The MemOS Cloud Service currently provides all developers with the following free development quotas for the APIs, calculated based on **number of calls**. Different APIs consume quota differently, as shown in the table below:

| API Name | Consumption Type | Description | Free Quota (Calls) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| addMessage | Number of calls | Each successful request consumes 1 call | 5,000 |
| searchMemory | Number of calls | Each successful request consumes 1 call | 1,000 |
| getMessage | Number of calls | Each successful request consumes 1 call | 5,000 |

::note
**Note**
- The free quota is provided per **developer account** and is shared across all projects under that account.
- Failed requests (authentication failure, parameter error, exceeding limits, etc.) **do not consume quota**.
::

## 2. Resource Limits

To ensure stable and secure service, MemOS Cloud Service enforces the following limits on API calls, calculated at the account level:

| API Name | Max Input per Request | Max Output per Request | Total Call Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| addMessage | 4,000 tokens | - | 5,000 |
| searchMemory | 4,000 tokens | 10 memories | 1,000 |
| getMessage | - | 50 messages | 5,000 |

::note
**Note**
- Requests exceeding the per-call limit will return the corresponding error code without deducting quota.
- Additionally, we recommend a maximum QPS â‰¤ 10 (i.e., up to 10 requests per second). This is not a strict limit, but high concurrency may be affected by platform capacity, so control request frequency according to actual needs.
::

## 3. Usage Monitoring

You can view the remaining quota for each API through the **API Console**, with filters for project, API key, and date to facilitate tracking and managing usage.

## 4. Obtaining More Quota

To help developers quickly try and validate features while considering resource costs, each developer is provided a **limited free quota**. When usage exceeds the free quota, the system will block excess requests and provide a prompt, ensuring platform stability.
