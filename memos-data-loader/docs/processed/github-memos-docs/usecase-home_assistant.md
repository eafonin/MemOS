title: Building a Home Life Assistant with Memory
desc: With the support of MemOS, a home assistant can connect daily chores and long-term plans, quickly understanding and responding to the user’s real needs.
---

## 1. Overview

When developing a home life assistant product, developers often encounter a problem: **once the dialogue context ends, user information is lost**.

*   User casually assigns a to-do (“Take the kids to the zoo on Saturday”)
*   User expresses a habit (“When reminding, first list the key points, then give one action suggestion”)
*   User introduces family information (“My wife is Xiaoyun, the child is 6 years old”)

If the assistant cannot remember this information, it will appear “heartless”: the next day when the user asks, “What plans do I have for the weekend?”, the assistant will have no idea what they are referring to.


### 1.1 Why not traditional RAG?

Many people’s first thought is: can we use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?  
But the characteristics of traditional RAG determine that it is not suitable for this kind of “personalized assistant” scenario:

| Traditional RAG | MemOS |
| --- | --- |
| Relies on static knowledge bases, requiring manual document maintenance | Information generated during dialogue can be directly written in, no extra maintenance needed |
| Can only mechanically return fragments, does not learn preferences | Automatically forms to-do items, preferences, and profiles from conversations |
| Focuses on “common knowledge”, unsuitable for personal information | Designed for individualized scenarios, supports long-term tracking and invocation |


### 1.2 Why not build your own solution?

Of course, you could try to store this information yourself, but this brings several challenges:

*   **Complex storage and retrieval logic**: must distinguish dialogue content, long-term memory, preferences, and facts, and ensure they can be retrieved as needed.
*   **Troublesome integration with LLMs**: not only storing data, but also embedding relevant information into the prompt before generating responses.
*   **Poor scalability**: as features increase (to-dos, preferences, profiles), the code becomes increasingly hard to maintain.


### 1.3 Why use MemOS?

When making a technical choice, you can intuitively compare three approaches:

| Approach | Characteristics | Limitations | Advantages of MemOS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Traditional RAG | Retrieves documents from a vector database and appends them into the prompt | Requires manual static document maintenance; cannot store personal to-dos/preferences; only mechanically returns fragments | Automatically captures key information from dialogues, supports personalization and dynamic updates |
| Self-built storage solution | Custom tables/cache to save dialogue information | Complex logic: must distinguish dialogues/long-term memory/preferences/profiles; still need to manually build prompt before model calls; poor scalability | MemOS encapsulates storage + retrieval + prompt injection, reducing developer burden |
| MemOS | Only two interfaces: `addMessage` for writing, `searchMemory` for retrieval | —— | Supports long-term tracking, preference retention, and profile integration; ready-to-use and easily extendable |

Only two API calls are needed:

*   `addMessage`: writes user or assistant messages into the system
*   `searchMemory`: retrieves relevant memories before model response and injects them into the prompt

With this, the assistant can truly appear “with memory”:

*   **Track to-dos**
    *   User says “Take the kids to the zoo on Saturday”
    *   A few days later asks “What plans do I have for the weekend?” → Assistant can answer accurately
        
*   **Maintain preferences** (future versions will support more fine-grained instruction completion)
    *   User says “When reminding, first list three key points + one short suggestion”
    *   Later asks “Help me plan next week’s housework distribution” → Assistant outputs in the preferred style
        
*   **Incorporate profiles**
    *   User says “My wife is Xiaoyun, the child is 6 years old”
    *   Later asks “Arrange a weekend activity for the family?” → Suggests a family-friendly activity plan

### 1.4 What does this case demonstrate?

We will use MemOS cloud service to quickly implement a home life assistant “that remembers the user.”  
When running the example script, developers will see complete logs:

*   Requests/responses for each `addMessage` and `searchMemory` call
*   Matched memory entries
*   Concatenated and full instructions  ← TODO: coming soon
*   Model responses (if LLM is not connected, a message will indicate [LLM not connected])

### 2.3 Code Explanation

1.   Set your MemOS API key and OpenAI key in environment variables  
2.   Instantiate `HomeAssistant`  
3.   Choose whether to run pre-configured dialogues (consumes 2 add calls and 2 search calls)  
4.   Use the `main()` function to interact with the assistant in a dialogue loop  
5.   The assistant calls `chat`, first performing `search` to retrieve memories, then using OpenAI for conversation, and finally performing `add` to store the memory
