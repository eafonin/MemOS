## 8Conclusion

In this work, we introduce a memory operating system designed for Large Language Models, aimed at collaboratively building foundational memory infrastructure for next-generation LLM applications.

MemOSprovides a unified abstraction and integrated management framework for heterogeneous memory types, including parameter memory, activation memory, and explicit plaintext memory. We propose a standardized memory unit,MemCube, and implement key modules for scheduling, lifecycle management, structured storage, and transparent augmentation. These components collectively enhance reasoning coherence, adaptability, and system scalability in LLMs.

Building on this foundation, we envision a future intelligent ecosystem centered on modular memory resources and supported by a decentralized memory marketplace. This paradigm shift enables the creation of next-generation AI systems capable of continual learning and long-term evolution.

Looking ahead, we plan to explore the following directions:

- •Cross-LLM Memory Sharing: Enable interoperability and module reuse across different foundation models by sharing parametric and activation memories. To support consistent semantics and secure exchange, we plan to extend theMemory Interchange Protocol (MIP)to define standard formats, compatibility rules, and trust mechanisms for cross-model/app memory transmission—facilitating collaborative knowledge transfer among agents.
- •Self-Evolving MemBlocks: Develop memory units capable of self-optimization, reconstruction, and evolution based on usage feedback, reducing the need for manual maintenance and supervision.
- •Scalable Memory Marketplace: Establish decentralized mechanisms for memory exchange, supporting asset-level transactions, collaborative updates, and distributed evolution to foster a sustainable AI ecosystem.

Overall, with the introduction ofMemOS, we aim to transform LLMs from closed, static generation systems to continuously evolving intelligent agents equipped with long-term memory, integrated knowledge, and behavioral plasticity.MemOSnot only addresses critical architectural limitations in current models but also lays the groundwork for cross-task, cross-platform, and multi-agent collaborative intelligence. Building on prior work demonstrating the potential of explicit memory and hierarchical memory representations in LLMs[1], we look forward to advancing the frontiers ofMemOSin collaboration with the community, making memory a first-class computational resource in the age of general-purpose AI.
