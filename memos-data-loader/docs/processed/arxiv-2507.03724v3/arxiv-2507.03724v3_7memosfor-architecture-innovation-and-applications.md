## 7MemOSfor Architecture Innovation and Applications

### 7.1Architectural Innovations Enabled byMemOS

MemOStreats memory as a first-class system resource, enabling unified lifecycle management and orchestration of memory in multiple forms.
This abstraction supports architectural innovations that focus on memory-driven modules and services, facilitating the modularization and reusability of knowledge assets.

#### 7.1.1Paid Memory as Modular Installables (User-Facing Paradigm)

MemOSis designed around a memory-centric architecture, offering modularized and assetized memory interfaces that allow knowledge to be uploaded, mounted, and invoked like a digital resource.
Under this paradigm, memory is no longer bound to training pipelines or development workflows but becomes a composable and user-controllable intelligence unit.

Concretely, domain experts can publish structured experiential memories viaMemStore, akin to publishing a knowledge plugin or an expert tip.
Consumers—students, enterprise agents, or assistant models—can install these memories using a standardized loading interface, subject to permission control.
This entire flow abstracts away the need for understanding the underlying model architecture or performing manual alignment.
It drastically reduces the barrier to memory usage and makes memory-driven intelligence available beyond developers and platform operators.

For instance, a medical student in clinical rotation may wish to study how to manage a rare autoimmune condition.
An experienced physician can encapsulate diagnostic heuristics, questioning paths, and typical case patterns into a structured memory and upload it toMemStore.
The student can then search, install, and invoke this memory locally via their assistant model.
This bypasses the need for building formal ontologies or coordinating structured knowledge base design, as is common in traditional clinical AI.

MemOSencapsulates this process as a standardized "Memory-as-a-Service" capability, greatly expanding the accessibility and reusability of expert knowledge.
Furthermore,MemGovernance, the dedicated control module inMemOS, offers full-spectrum privacy and access control for memory assets.
It enables memory providers to define custom access conditions over their published content.
For example, a medical expert may restrict installation rights to users who have completed a micropayment, enabling a form of licensed intelligence delivery.

#### 7.1.2Painless Memory Management (Task-Oriented Paradigm)

MemOSabstracts memory as a universal, long-lived, and shareable infrastructure resource, architecturally analogous to storage subsystems in traditional operating systems.
This design elevates memory from a model-embedded utility to a first-class system-level asset with its own lifecycle and invocation semantics.

Unlike conventional transient memory techniques limited to context windows or parameter embeddings,MemOSoffers standardized memory interfaces, a unified access protocol, and structured persistence formats.
This enables runtime tasks to flexibly read, write, mount, fuse, or replace memory blocks on demand,
without requiring manual state tracking or architectural alignment.

Neither users nor developers need to handle low-level vector indexing, KV-caching, or context orchestration logic.
Instead, they can access and update memory seamlessly through task-levelMemory APIcalls.
This infrastructure-level abstraction proves especially valuable in multi-stage, long-horizon, and evolving tasks.

For example, in an intelligent legal assistant system, a user may complete a corporate contract review task in distinct phases:
the first phase may focus on structural layout and terminological consistency;
the second phase may highlight risky clauses and compare precedent cases;
and the final phase may involve checking compliance against current regulations.MemOSdynamically loads the appropriate memory sets at each stage (e.g., “Contract Template Memory”, “Risk Clause Case Logs”, “Recent Regulation Digest”),
and performs hot-swapping and cache eviction as task contexts evolve.
Throughout the task lifecycle, the user need not explicitly manage memory policies;
the system automatically schedules the relevant memory assets based on context semantics,
delivering a “memory-as-resource, use-on-demand” intelligent task execution experience.

### 7.2MemOSApplication Scenarios

#### 7.2.1Supporting Multi-Turn Dialogue and Cross-Task Continuity

Real-world interactions rarely reveal user intent in a single turn; instead, goals are refined progressively over multiple exchanges. However, traditional LLMs rely on static context windows, making it difficult to retain key semantic states across turns, resulting in “memory loss” between dialogue rounds.

For instance, in a procurement negotiation task, a user might set a budget cap of ¥300,000 in round 5, later revise product preferences in round 12 to prioritize domestic alternatives, yet by round 15, the model reverts to recommending high-priced imports based on earlier defaults.

MemOSaddresses this at the system level by extracting salient elements (e.g., budget, preferences, delivery constraints) after each user input and encoding them into structured “conversation memory units.” These are linked to the ongoing task’s long-term memory path viaMemLink.

During inference,MemSchedulerretrieves relevant historical fragments based on current context and integrates them into the active reasoning path. This ensures continuity of semantic state and prevents logic drift due to “context sliding.”

Furthermore,MemOSsupports cross-task memory reuse to enable dialogue continuity and state persistence. For example, after completing an auto-form-filling task, the system retains memory of ID details or user habits. When the user later initiates a “visa application” task,MemOSrecalls the previously stored data (e.g., from “passport issuance”), enabling seamless state transition across tasks.

#### 7.2.2Supporting Knowledge Evolution and Continuous Update

Modern knowledge is dynamic, yet LLMs are generally trained once with static datasets. Updating their internal knowledge either requires expensive fine-tuning or introduces risks like catastrophic forgetting. Even RAG approaches lack lifecycle, version, or governance mechanisms—leading to fragmented, unverifiable external knowledge.

MemOSredefines knowledge as dynamic, lifecycle-governed memory. Each memory unit evolves independently, with defined stages for generation, replacement, fusion, and deprecation. The system schedules updates based on usage frequency, contextual alignment, and semantic overlap.

For example, when updated clinical guidelines are published, medical authorities can release them as explicit memory blocks viaMemStore.MemOStags them as “trusted sources,” compares them with older versions, and suggests updates to users.

At inference time,MemSchedulerprioritizes trusted and active versions, while obsolete entries are archived. This allows the model to remain up-to-date without retraining or harming prior knowledge structures.

MemOSalso supports personalized knowledge development. For instance, a cancer specialist may iteratively add interpretations and heuristics to drug usage. Over time, these refinements are integrated into their personal memory path, coexisting with official guidelines and selected based on task context.

#### 7.2.3Enabling Personalization and Multi-Role Modeling

LLMs today often operate statelessly across users and roles, unable to remember stylistic preferences or distinguish between user roles in complex settings. As a result, users must re-specify information every time, and models struggle to maintain consistent identity or behavior.

MemOSprovides system-level support for identity-aware memory and role-based behavior. Each user identity is associated with dedicated memory spaces, and multiple roles can coexist under one account.

For example, a user may interact as both a “parent” managing home tasks and a “manager” handling contracts.MemOSkeeps memory streams separate and dynamically loads the appropriate persona during inference.

In addition, long-term interaction patterns are encoded into “personal memory units” capturing language tone, response preferences, or value leanings. These units are incorporated into inference, yielding a personalized and coherent AI behavior.

In enterprise contexts,MemOSallows deployment of predefined role templates with task scopes, permission controls, and memory sync strategies. For example, an organization may define roles for analysts, assistants, and project leads, each with distinct memory access and agent behavior.

#### 7.2.4Enabling Cross-Platform Memory Migration

In a world of multi-device, multi-agent environments, valuable user-model memories often become locked within individual platforms, creating “memory silos” that break continuity and fragment knowledge accumulation.

MemOSresolves this through standardized memory representations, encryption, and platform-agnostic mount protocols. All memory blocks are portable across environments—from mobile to cloud to enterprise infrastructure.

For example, a user’s “family travel preference” memory built via mobile assistant—including flight timing, hotel type, and budget—can be selectively migrated to a corporate travel planning agent on desktop, enabling consistent and efficient decision-making.

By breaking the memory silo,MemOStransforms memory from a private asset embedded in a single model to a distributed, governable, and reusable intelligence layer across platforms.
